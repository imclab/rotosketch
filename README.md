rotosketch
==========

rotosketch for motionbank workshop

requires OF 0.8

requires ofxUI  (IIRC I might have made something protected public, so if you get a compile error, it's that.  I needed to sense if a slider is highlighted)

be sure to set delpoyment target to 6.0 (not 7.0) for proper compiling.  IOS + 0.8 OF seems to have issues with deployment target iOS 7, you'll see errors around tr1 / memory in types.h.
